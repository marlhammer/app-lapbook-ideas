This lap book was done during a 3 month parent/student designed unit study.  Parent give ideas on
some of the minit books and how the extensions were to go in before the study began.  Parent also
gave criteria to be included and the deadlines for each minit book.  Sources were the Timeline Folder
from Tobin's Lab catalog, Dover coloring books, World Book Encyclopedia, library books, and 
Bob Jones history.
