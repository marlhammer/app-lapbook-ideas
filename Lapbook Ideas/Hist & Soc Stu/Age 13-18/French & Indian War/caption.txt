This was a 1 week study wih no parental involvement in the construction of the lap book.  The 
information sources were pictures from the Coloring Book of the American Revolution by Bellerophon
Books, The Light and the Glory for Children, Little Bear Wheeler audio tapes, and 4th and 8th grade
ABEKA history books.
