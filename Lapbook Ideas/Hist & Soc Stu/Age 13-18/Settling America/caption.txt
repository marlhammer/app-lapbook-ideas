Settling America

This book came about during a 1 week study with no parental involvement in the construction of the
lap book.  The sources used were One Nation Under God republished by Mantle Ministries, Story of 
Liberty and Old Times in the Colonies republished by Mantle Ministries.

Photo 2 shows the center of the book with small single fold books that open up.  Photo 3 shows a
Miles Standish extension and Squanto book.  Photo 4 shows that there is quite a bit of writing in
the Squanto book.
