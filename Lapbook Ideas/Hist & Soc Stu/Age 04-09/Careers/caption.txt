Careers

Tyler, age 10

This lap book was made on a Konos co-op day.  All the graphics came off the internet and Tyler's
computer.  In order to make this lap book, Tyler also interview 3 different people about their
careers.

Photo 2 shows match books of the different careers studied.  Photo 3 shows his writing of what he
want's to be as well as his picture.  Photo 4 shows more match books of careers.  The booklet opens
to contain the write up about the particular career. Photo 5 shows the inside cover with a Bible
verse written inside (Ps 139:13-16).  The last photo shows the results of the career interviews.
