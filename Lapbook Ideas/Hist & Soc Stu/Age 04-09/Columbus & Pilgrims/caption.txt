Columbus

Jake, age 5

This lap book was created during a 2 1/2 month teacher designed unit study with a kindergarten
home school co-op that met 3 times a month.  This lap book required heavy parent/teacher
involvement.  Sources included Draw Write Now curriculum, various activity books, and library 
books.
