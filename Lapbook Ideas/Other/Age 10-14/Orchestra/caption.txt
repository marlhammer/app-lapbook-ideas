Orchestra

This lap book was made by Heather, age 10.  The topic is Music.  The co-op met once a week for
a month.  The information sources were library books and the internet for pictures.

The small books were pre-cut before classes to save time.  The students then filled the in during
class.

Photo 2 is the inside of the lap book.  Photo 3 is the four time periods extension.  Photo 4 is the 
composers extension and photo 5 is the parts of the orchestra top tab book.
