Art

Austin, age 4

This was a year long teacher designed study on art concepts with a home school co-op that met
3 days a month.  This was a hands-on "A to Z" study of art that the preschoolers really 
enjoyed and learned a lot from.  Heavy parent/teacher involvement.  Sources:  magazine pictures,
poem written by the Mom who taught the class.
