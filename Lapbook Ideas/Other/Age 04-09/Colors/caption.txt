This lap book is an alphabet/color/number book.  Photo 2 shows letters of the alphabet.  Photo 3 shows 
primary colors sponged onto the page with matchbook booklets attached.  Photo 4 shows that under
the flap (opens upward) are number strips.  5 shows colored pictures of each primary color and
a story written about each.

This is an ongoing book and is added to each time a new letter, color, or number is learned.
