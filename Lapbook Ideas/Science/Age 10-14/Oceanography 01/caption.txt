This lap book was put together from magazine, brochure, coloring books and pictures taken during
a trip to Southern California with a marine biologist.

Photo 2 shows the exploring tide pools extensions.  Photo 3 shows the what kills them? extension.  
Photos 4,5,6,7 illustrate the tide pool, thank you, looking under the crab shell, squid dissection
and hatching grunion eggs extensions.
