Botany	

Annie, Age 13

Annie did this lap book over a 6 week study in Botany.  The sources of information were Konos Vol 1,
Discovery Science by Frank Shaffer, library books and "A Pocket Full of Goobers by Barbara Mitchell.

Photo 2 shows the parts of a flower extension along with reading vocabulary note cards and the life 
cycle of a seed.  Photo 3 shows plant parts, plant classification and a photosynthesis accordion 
question and answer book.  Photo 4 shows the book report on "A Pocket Full of Goobers".

This plant unit study provided a great opportunity to write across the curriculm.  Poetry enhanced the
study and provided an opportunity for Annie to write her own.
