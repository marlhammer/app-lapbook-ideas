Cautiousness

Stephanie, age 12

This lap book is about Prairie Dogs and Cautiousness.  This was a one week study with no parental
involvement in making it.  The parent read the information while the kids worked on the book.

Photo 2 shows a center shutter extension.  All of the small booklets are single folds.  The bottom 
center book opens down and the left book has the prairie dog tunnel cut out of the front page.  

Photo 3 shows that there is a bound booklet in the center of the extension.
