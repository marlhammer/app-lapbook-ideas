Weather

Gracie, age 6

This little weather lap book was done over a 4 week study using library books, Konos Vol 11, 
and Kids Discover Magazine.  The 2nd photo shows a tri-fold cloud shaped book with information 
describing cloud types.  There is book shaped like a tornado and a layer type book showing 
Meteorologist's tools.  Included is a Water Cycle Wheel and a photo of "The Weather Game".

Gracie found this book enjoyable and easy to put together.  The pockets on the front cover holds
cards for playing a weather clothing sorting game.
