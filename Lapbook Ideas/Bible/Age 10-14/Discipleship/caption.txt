Chris,  (age not given but older than both of her children)

This lap book was done as a sample to show moms how to make them.  Chris teaches lap book making
in Phoenix, AZ.  This type of lap book can be made in Sunday School with the children or at home
for family Bible study.

Photo 2 has Jesus raised Lazarus and the names of God shutter fold extensions.  Photo 3 shows the
Lazarus pictures cut out and glued onto the question/answer book.  Photo 4 shows a Jonah and the 
Whale tri-fold extension.  (Please don't call and explain that the Bible doesn't say it was a 
whale but rather a giant fish.  Thanks.)  

Photo 5 is the Psalm 23/god creates the world extension and photo 6 show those extensions opened.
Jesus has risen and Joseph's coat extensions are shown on photo 7.
